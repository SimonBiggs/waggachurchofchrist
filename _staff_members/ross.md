blurb: |-
  With more than 20 years of full time ministry experience, my wife Lyn and I are just as keen to serve the Lord among his people as ever!

  We love Wagga and this church. We have 6 adult Children, with some living here. I have a deep commitment to the Word of God, to discipleship and to the family nature of church which means we must stay relevant to all ages.

  I came to Christ quite young and have stayed passionate about the development of young Christians, so I am delighted to work among such a talented variety of Christian leaders such as those in our Youth and Music teams.

  Ultimately, Jesus is the true leader of the church and each Christian must walk with Him at the centre of their life, and Ministry is therefore about humbly keeping in step with Jesus 'the Author and Perfecter of our faith' (Hebrews 12:2).
